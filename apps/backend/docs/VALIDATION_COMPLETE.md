# ✅ Tree Settings Validation - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 What We Built

A comprehensive validation system that prevents users from accidentally breaking their family trees by disabling features (like polygamy or same-sex unions) when such relationships already exist in the tree.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Validation Rules (6 types)

| #   | Rule          | Protects Against                                     |
| --- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Monogamy      | Enabling monogamy when members have multiple spouses |
| 2   | Same-Sex      | Disabling same-sex when same-sex couples exist       |
| 3   | Single Parent | Disabling single parents when children have 1 parent |
| 4   | Multi-Parent  | Disabling multi-parent when children have >2 parents |
| 5   | Max Spouses   | Reducing spouse limit below current maximum          |
| 6   | Max Parents   | Reducing parent limit below current maximum          |

### 2. API Endpoints (2)

| Endpoint                           | Method | Purpose                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `/api/trees/{id}`                  | PATCH  | Update settings (with validation) |
| `/api/trees/{id}/settings/preview` | POST   | Preview impact (no changes)       |

### 3. Error Responses

- **409 Conflict** - Detailed violation messages
- **Impact Analysis** - Shows what's affected
- **Resolution Guidance** - Suggestions for fixing

---

## 🔍 How It Works

```
User Changes Settings
         ↓
Validate Against Existing Data
         ↓
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
Valid?     Invalid?
    │         │
    ↓         ↓
 Apply     Block + Details
```

### Validation Process

1. **Extract current settings** from database
2. **Compare with proposed settings**
3. **Query existing relationships**
4. **Check each constraint**
5. **Collect violations**
6. **Return result** (allow or block with details)

---

## 💻 Code Examples

### Backend Validation

```python
# In api/trees.py
is_valid, errors = validate_settings_change(
    db_session,
    tree_id,
    current_settings,
    new_settings
)

if not is_valid:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=409,
        detail={
            "message": "Settings change would violate existing relationships",
            "errors": errors,
            "suggestion": "Remove conflicts first"
        }
    )
```

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
// React component
const handleSettingsChange = async (newSettings) => {
  try {
    // Preview first
    const preview = await previewSettings(newSettings);

    if (!preview.can_apply) {
      showWarnings(preview.validation_errors);
      return;
    }

    // Apply if safe
    await updateSettings(newSettings);
    showSuccess();
  } catch (error) {
    showError(error.message);
  }
};
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Test Cases (7)

1. ✅ Monogamy violation detection
2. ✅ Same-sex violation detection
3. ✅ Single parent violation detection
4. ✅ Multi-parent violation detection
5. ✅ Max spouses violation detection
6. ✅ Max parents violation detection
7. ✅ Empty tree validation (should pass)

### Run Tests

```bash
cd apps/backend
python test_tree_validation.py
```

**Expected Output**:

```
============================================================
Tree Settings Validation Tests
============================================================

✓ Monogamy violations detected: ['John Smith']
✓ Same-sex violations detected: ['Alice & Amy']
✓ Single parent violations detected: ['Child']
✓ Multi-parent violations detected: ['Child with 3 parents']
✓ Max spouses violations detected: [('King Henry', 4)]
✓ Max parents violations detected: [('Shared custody child', 4)]
✓ Empty tree has no violations

============================================================
✅ All tests passed!
============================================================
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Safe Change (Empty Tree)

```bash
# Tree has no members yet
curl -X PATCH "/api/trees/{id}" \
  -d '{"settings": {"monogamy": true}}'

# Response: 200 OK ✅
```

### Example 2: Blocked Change (Violations)

```bash
# Tree has members with multiple spouses
curl -X PATCH "/api/trees/{id}" \
  -d '{"settings": {"monogamy": true}}'

# Response: 409 Conflict ❌
{
  "detail": {
    "message": "Settings change would violate existing relationships",
    "errors": [
      "Cannot enable monogamy: 2 member(s) have multiple spouses. Members affected: John Smith, Jane Doe"
    ],
    "impact": {...},
    "suggestion": "Remove or modify the conflicting relationships first"
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Preview Before Apply

```bash
# Check impact without applying
curl -X POST "/api/trees/{id}/settings/preview" \
  -d '{"monogamy": true}'

# Response: 200 OK with impact analysis
{
  "can_apply": false,
  "validation_errors": ["..."],
  "recommendation": "Cannot apply - would violate..."
}
```
