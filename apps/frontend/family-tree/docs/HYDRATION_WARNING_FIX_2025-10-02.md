# Hydration Warning Fix - October 2, 2025

## Issue: React Hydration Mismatch

### Error Message

```
Warning: Extra attributes from the server: class,style
    at html
    at RootLayout (Server)
```

### Cause

The `next-themes` library dynamically adds `class` and `style` attributes to the `<html>` element on the client side to implement dark mode. These attributes are not present during server-side rendering, causing a hydration mismatch warning.

**What happens:**

1. Server renders: `<html lang="en">`
2. Client hydrates: `<html lang="en" class="dark" style="...">`
3. React detects mismatch → Warning

### Solution

Add `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<html>` element to tell React that attribute differences are expected and safe.

**Before:**

```tsx
<html lang="en">
  <body className={inter.className} suppressHydrationWarning>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
  <body className={inter.className}>
```

### Why This Works

- `suppressHydrationWarning` tells React to ignore hydration mismatches for that specific element
- This is the recommended approach for theme libraries that modify the `<html>` tag
- The warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality, but suppressing it keeps the console clean

### Reference

This is a known pattern with `next-themes` and is documented in their official docs:
